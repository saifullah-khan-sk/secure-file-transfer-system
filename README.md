# 🔐 Secure File Transfer System

A secure, GUI-based file transfer and messaging system implemented in Python, designed for confidential communication and file sharing. It leverages **AES** and **RSA** encryption to ensure end-to-end privacy, while allowing users to authenticate, share files, and download them securely with custom decryption passphrases.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔑 **Hybrid Encryption**: Files are encrypted with unique AES keys; AES keys are encrypted using user-defined passphrases via AES and RSA.
- 🧑‍💻 **User Authentication**: Per-session username and password system with custom decryption passphrase input.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform GUI**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive client-server graphical interface.
- 📁 **Drag-and-Drop File Sharing**: Supports sending multiple files without size restriction.
- 🗃️ **Server File Management**: Server displays a list of received files and allows secure downloads with passphrase verification.
- 🔐 **Password-Protected ZIP**: Downloaded files are saved in password-protected ZIP format for additional security.
